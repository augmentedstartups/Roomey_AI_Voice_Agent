AI needs hardware.\n    \u21b3 Models like GPT-4 don't run on thin air.\n    \u21b3 They need massive computing power.\n2.  NVIDIA provides that power.\n    \u21b3 They build the GPUs.\n    \u21b3 The essential infrastructure for the AI revolution.\n3.  Market cap tells a story.\n    \u21b3 NVIDIA at $3T.\n    \u21b3 OpenAI at $80B.\n    \u21b3 One builds the picks and shovels, the other digs.\n4.  Talent is key.\n    \u21b3 Both compete for the best minds.\n    \u21b3 But the builders often win long-term.\n5.  Focus on the enablers.\n    \u21b3 The companies building the *platform*.\n    \u21b3 Not just the applications.\n\nUnderstand the infrastructure.\n\nThat's where the leverage is.\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Repost this if you agree.\nFollow @Ritesh Kanjee and @Augmented AI to never miss a post.",
