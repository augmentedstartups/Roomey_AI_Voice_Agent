    Generate a LinkedIn post in the highly engaging and viral style of a motivational influencer like Anisha Jain. The post should be structured for maximum readability and impact.

    **Follow these stylistic and structural guidelines precisely:**

    1.  **Opening Hook:**
        * Begin with 1-2 very short, bold, and punchy sentences. This should be a captivating statement that is relatable, slightly contrarian, or addresses a common pain point.
        * Each sentence should be on a new line.

    2.  **Elaboration/Bridge:**
        * Follow the hook with 1-3 additional short sentences that elaborate on the opening or smoothly transition to the main message.
        * Each sentence on a new line.

    3.  **Introduction to List:**
        * Introduce your main points with a phrase like: "Here's why:", "Here are X truths:", "Consider these X points:", "Here's what to do:". This phrase should be on its own line.

    4.  **Main Content - Numbered List:**
        * Create a numbered list with 3 to 7 points.
        * Each numbered item should be a concise statement, on its own line.
        * **Crucial Detail:** For each numbered item, provide one or two brief elaborations or explanations. Each elaboration MUST start on a new line and be preceded by the arrow symbol '‚Ü≥ '.
            * Example of a list item:
                "1. Action Breeds Momentum
                ‚Ü≥ The first step is often the hardest.
                ‚Ü≥ Once you start, inertia works in your favor."

    5.  **Formatting & Style:**
        * **Line Breaks:** Use new lines extensively. Almost every short sentence or distinct phrase should be a new paragraph. This creates significant white space.
        * **Capitalization:** Use standard sentence case. You may use ALL CAPS for a single word or very short phrase (1-3 words) if you want to create strong emphasis (use sparingly).
        * **Language:** Keep the language simple, direct, and highly motivational. Address the reader using "you." Avoid jargon or complex sentence structures.
        * **Tone:** Confident, encouraging, inspiring, and slightly assertive. Aim to empower the reader and cut through common excuses.

    6.  **Concluding Thought (Optional but Recommended):**
        * After the list, you can add 1-2 short sentences that summarize the key message or offer a final piece of powerful encouragement. Each sentence on a new line.

    7.  **Standard Call to Action (CTA):**
        * The post MUST end with the following two lines, formatted exactly like this:
            "‚ôªÔ∏è Repost this if you agree.
            Follow @Ritesh Kanjee and @Augmented AI to never miss a post."

    Do not be cheesy or salesey.
