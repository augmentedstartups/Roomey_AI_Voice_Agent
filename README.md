## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Roomey on your system:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ installed on your system
- Git for cloning the repository
- Internet connection for API access
- Google Gemini API key 

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/augmentedstartups/Roomey_AI_Voice_Agent.git
   cd Roomey_AI_Voice_Agent
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

3. **Activate the environment**
   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   myenv\bin\activate  # On Windows
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # On macOS
   pip install -r windows_requirements.txt  # On linux/windows
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` in the root directory
   - Update the environment variables
   - The `PERSONALIZED_PROMPT` allows you to customize the AI's understanding of who you are

6. **MCP Integration**

  - Roomey now supports dynamic MCP integration using a config file, not environment variables.
  - Configure one or more MCP servers in `integrations/mcp/mcp_servers.json` (see below).
  - The assistant can call any tool on any configured MCP server.
  - Example tool call:
    ```
    {
      "server_name": "calculator",
      "tool_name": "add",
      "parameters": {"a": 2, "b": 3}
    }
    ```

### Running Roomey

1. **Activate the environment** (if not already activated)
   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the main application**
   ```bash
   python main_mac.py
   ```

3. **Interact with Roomey**
   - Speak naturally to Roomey
   - Ask questions, request information, or give commands
   - Explore the various integrations

## MCP Integration (Multi-Server, Dynamic Launch)

Roomey can now launch and connect to any number of MCP servers, defined in a JSON config file. No environment variable is needed to enable MCP; if `integrations/mcp/mcp_servers.json` exists and is valid, all servers will be launched and available as tools.

### Configuration

1. **Edit or create `integrations/mcp/mcp_servers.json`:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "calculator": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-calculator"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Each server entry defines how to launch the server (command, args, and optional env vars).
- You can add as many servers as you like.
- The config file path can be overridden with the `MCP_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

2. **On startup, Roomey will:**
   - Launch each server as a subprocess.
   - Wait briefly for servers to start.
   - Register a `call_mcp_tool` function for Gemini, allowing you to call any tool on any configured server.

### Usage

- The `call_mcp_tool` function is available if at least one server is configured.
- You can call tools on any server by specifying the `server_name` (as in the config), `tool_name`, and parameters.

### Example

To add a new server, add an entry to `mcp_servers.json`:

```json
"my_custom_server": {
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-custom", "--option"]
}
```

**Note:** MCP integration is now fully config-driven. There is no need for any MCP-related environment variable.
